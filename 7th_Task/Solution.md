## **Spec Kit Plus 👑**   

It is a simple toolkit that helps you plan and build software in a clean, organized, and AI friendly way.   

Instead of writing code directly, Speckit-Plus encourages you to start with a clear specification, a written plan that explains what you want to build, how it should work, and what features it needs.   
This plan becomes the main guide for both you and any AI tools you use during development.      

**In Short**

Spec Kit Plus is like a `blueprint maker` for our software.
We write the plan once, and both of us (I and the AI Agent) follow it to build the actual application.   


### The 5 Phases of Spec Kit Plus

## 🔴 ***/constitution***   

This is the starting point of our project.   
We define the project’s identity (what it is, why it exists, and what problem it solves)   
It is basically the `Foundation` of our project   


## 🟢 ***/specify***   

Here we write a clear specification of our app.
We describe the features, workflows, rules, and how everything should behave.   
This becomes the main guide for the whole project.   

## 🟠 ***/plan***   

In this step, we turn the specification into a practical plan.   
We decide what needs to be built first, what comes later, and how the work should be organized.   
It’s like creating a simple roadmap.    

## 🟡 ***/tasks***   

Now we break the plan into small, clear tasks.   
These tasks are easy for us (the developers) and AI agents to understand and complete.   
It’s the stage where big ideas turn into actionable steps.   

## 🟣 ***/implement***   

Finally, we build the actual product.     
Developers and/or AI agents write the code based on the tasks and plan.    
This is where the project becomes real and functional.
