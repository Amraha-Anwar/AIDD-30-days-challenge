## 🍊 Part A (Theory)

### **1. Nine Pillars Understanding** 

**1: Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks better for your growth as a system architect?**  
- Using AI agents for repetitive tasks frees up your 🧠 and saves ⏱️  
- As an architect, your main job is **design + architecture-first thinking + complex problem-solving**  
- Delegating the boring boilerplate to AI = more energy for big picture awesomeness 😎  


**Q2: How do the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped Developer?**  
- The Nine Pillars (agents, TDD, specs, etc.) let **one dev act like a whole team**   
- AI helps fill knowledge gaps, letting you get deep skills in **2–4 complementary domains** basically, becoming M-Shaped        



### **2. Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development** 

**Q1: Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after a week?**  
- Vibe Coding = coding with intuition, no plan   
- Fast at first, but architecture becomes messy & hard to extend 😬  
- Code becomes unstable and confusing shortly after it’s written  


**Q2: How does Specification-Driven Development (SDD) prevent this?**  
- SDD = writing **clear, executable specs before coding**   
- Makes sure architecture is solid from day 1 🏗️  
- Saves your future self from endless headaches     



### **3. Architecture Thinking** 

**Q1: How does architecture-first thinking change the developer’s role in AIDD?**  
- Shifts role from **code monkey 🐒** to **system level thinker**  
- AI handles raw code, you focus on **layers, systems, and giving high-level instructions**  


**Q2: Why must devs think in layers & systems instead of raw code?**  
- AIDD uses a **3-Layer Architecture**: Models → IDEs → Agents     
- Layer-3 Development Agents are **autonomous tools** executing multi-step tasks from your instructions  
- Thinking systemically = scalable, maintainable, and way cooler than line-by-line coding

## 🍊 Part B (Practical)   

### **My given prompt:**   

> Write a one-paragraph specification for a function that checks email address integrity. 
> The specification must explicitly include the "@" character, require a valid domain extensio(like .com > or .org), 
> and detail the clear error messages to be returned upon failure.   

### **The specification I got**
